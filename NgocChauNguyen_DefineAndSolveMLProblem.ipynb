    "5. In my opinion, it is an important problem, as if companies want to invest in and host multiple Airbnbs, they would love to predict which Airbnb can potentially receive high scores before buying back that Airbnb and earn profit in the future. The rating is based on different features, such as host_location, host_response_rate, availability_30. Besides that, they can use the model to stimulate a scenario--they would use an example house as a data point to check if it would become a good Airbnb before they actually buy it/ build it in that specific location. The prediction will also give companies incentives to take good care of the property, which are reflected through some features, such as \"review_scores_cleanliness\", \"review_scores_communication\", \"instant_bookable\". \n"
